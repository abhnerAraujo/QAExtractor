# QAExtractor

This project seeks to implement a question/answer extractor API. The implementation is based on this [article][artic1], which proposes reverse-engineering Q&A collections from any text. 
The final purpose of this project is to viabilize the creation of a chatbot capable of help high school studants on their studies, acting as a academic monitoring.
This project is also a part of a graduation work, at the Centro de Inform√°tica (CIn) - Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE).

### Tech (dependencies)

* **LinguaKit** - A Natural Language Processing tool (Perl)
* **Node.Js** - An open source server environment

* Follow [Node.Js][node]'s installation instructions
* Fork this repository
* Use:
```sh

### Limitations

As said before, this implemetation was a part of a graduation project therefore needs some refactoring or you will be experiencing a lot of slowness (bad scalability).

### TODO
